        <h3>What is an Evil Twin</h3>
        <p>Evil twin is a term for a rogue Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate one offered
        on the premises, but actually has been set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications.</p>
    
        <p>An evil twin is the wireless version of the phishing scam. An attacker fools wireless users into
        connecting a laptop or mobile phone to a tainted hotspot by posing as a legitimate provider.</p>
    
        <p>This type of evil twin attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users by either
        snooping the communication link or by phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent web site and
        luring people there.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="method">
    	<h3>How it happens</h3>
        <p>The attacker uses a bogus wireless access point, purporting to provide wireless Internet
        services, but snooping on the traffic. When the users log into unprotected (non-HTTPS) bank or
        e-mail accounts, the attacker has access to the entire transaction, since it is sent through their
        equipment.</p>
    
        <p>Unwitting web users are invited to log into the attacker's server with bogus login prompts,
        tempting them to give away sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. Often users are
        unaware they have been duped until well after the incident has occurred.</p>
    
        <p>Users think they have logged on to a wireless hotspot connection when in fact they have been
        tricked into connecting to its evil twin by it sending a stronger signal within proximity to the
        wireless client.</p>
    
        <p>Rogue access points are easy to set up, for example using a laptop with a wireless card that
        acts as an access point (known as "host-ap"), but are hard to trace since they can suddenly be shut
        off. An attacker can make his own wireless networks that appear to be legitimate by simply giving
        their access point a similar SSID name to the Wi-Fi network on the premises. The rogue access point
        can be configured to pass the traffic through to the legitimate access point while monitoring the
        victim's traffic, or it can simply say the system is temporarily unavailable after obtaining a
       	username and password.</p>

    <section id="solutions">
    	<h3>How to resolve the issues</h3>
        <p>Virtual private networks or end-to-end encryption (such as TLS/SSL/HTTPS) may be used to protect
        passwords, e-mail and other sensitive information.</p>
    
        <p>Most existing evil twin detection solutions can be classified into two categories. The first
        kind of solution approaches monitor Radio Frequency (RF) airwaves and/or additional information 	
        gathered at routers/switches and then compare with a known authorized list. The second kind of 	
        approaches monitor traffic at the wired side (a traffic aggregation point such as a gateway), and 	
        determine whether a machine uses wired or wireless connections. Such information is further 	
        compared with an authorization list to detect if the associated AP is a rogue one. These approaches
        are limited because they all require the knowledge of an authorization list of APs and/or
        users/hosts.
