    	<h2>Hit Series return September 22nd!</h2>
            <p>
            The nerds of Silicon Valley return this Fall to HBO with new version problems.
            Their victory at Tech-Crunch Disrupt have set the standards high and now Richard Hendricks
            is faced with decisions that effect everyone he cares about.
            </p>
            <p>
            Build apps is hard, but building a company projected at a multi-Billion dollar value is hard in epic proportions.
            Who would have thought a company like PidedPiper could compete with the big guys like Houli.
            </p>
            <p>
            Erlich Bachmann, Dinesh, Peter Gregory and Jared Dunn support Richard through his topsy-turvy adventure. Spirits are
            high, and so is some of the help. This rag-tag team wants to roll 'High Roller' style, but breaking into the rich and
            famous crowd is no easy task.
